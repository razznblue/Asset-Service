# The SWGU-Library

## The Media Storage Server of SWGU
 - All assets related to the game live here including:
   - Images
   - Audio
   - Raw JSON Files

## Data 
Files can be uploaded to the drive to a specific folder differentiated by category.
The home page offers actions such as downloading the entire drive or specific modules by category.
You can view all assets which will show you all assets currently living in the service and are ready to be used.

## Adding a New Folder to the Drive
The folder must be a child of either the IMAGES, AUDIO, or JSON folder.
